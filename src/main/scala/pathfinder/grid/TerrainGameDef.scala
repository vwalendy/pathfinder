/** The case class `Pos` encodes positions in the terrain.

  * IMPORTANT NOTES
  *   - The `row` coordinate denotes the vertical position on the grid
  *   - The `col` coordinate denotes the horizontal position on the grid
  *   - These coordinates increase when moving down or to the right
  *
  * Illustration:
  *
  * ```
  *     0 1 2 3   <- col axis
  *   0 o o o o
  *   1 o o o o
  *   2 o # o o    # is at position Pos(2, 1)
  *   3 o o o o
