/** This component implements a parser to define terrains from a graphical ASCII
  * representation.
  *
  * When mixing in that component, a level can be defined by defining the field
  * `level` in the following form:
  *
  * ```
  *   val level =
  *     """------
  *       |--ST--
  *       |--oo--
  *       |--oo--
  *       |------""".stripMargin
  * ```
  *
  *   - The `-` character denotes parts which are outside the terrain
  *   - `o` denotes fields which are part of the terrain
  *   - `S` denotes the start position of the block (which is also considered
  *     inside the terrain)
  *   - `T` denotes the final position of the block (which is also considered
  *     inside the terrain)
  *
  * In this example, the first and last lines could be omitted, and also the
  * columns that consist of `-` characters only.
